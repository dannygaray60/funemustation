A simple but elegant launcher of emulators and pc games


A simple but elegant launcher for emulators (and pc games)
FES Launcher allows you to configure the executables of your favorite emulators that you have downloaded and associate them to a folder of roms, so you can view the games with their respective covers and play comfortably seated as FES Launcher allows you to close the emulator using a Gamepad.

Compatibility with many emulators
In theory, any emulator that can be executed under command line is compatible with FES Launcher. In Windows environment it has been tested with the most popular emulators of platforms such as NES (fceux, nestopia), SNES (snes9x), Nintendo64 (project64), Gamecube/Wii (dolphin), Playstation (epsxe), Playstation Portable (ppsspp), Gameboy (and Advance) (mGBA), Nintendo DS (desmume), Sega megadrive (bizhawk) and Nintendo 3DS (citra) working without any problem. Most of them even running in full screen from the launcher itself for a greater immersion.

Compatibility with 32 and 64 bits systems. And Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems.
It should work even in toasters I think xD

Minimalist, but elegant interface.
Feels like you're using a modern console ;)

Optimization
By default FES Launcher consumes approximately 250mb of RAM and 10% of CPU, but when running an emulator from the launcher it will go to a low power mode (30 mb of RAM and less than 3% of CPU use) prioritizing a higher performance of the emulator executed.

Easy Configuration
FES Launcher offers a simple but effective way to configure emulators and roms directories (read the attached user manual).

Technical support
Through the itchio project page you will be able to count on technical support from the developer himself to guide you in the use of this Launcher with the above mentioned emulators.
